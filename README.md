# Frontend

## What you'll need

1. You'll need `nodejs` installed
2. Clone this repo
3. `npm install`

## Instructions

1.  Run the server with `node app.js` You'll see the heart rate data at `localhost:3000/heartrate`
2.  Create a new React app in your repo
3.  Fetch data from the endpoint `localhost:3000/heartrate`
4.  Visualise the data in your React app! This should meet the following criteria, but the way you do this is up to you..
    1.  It should have a chart
    2.  You should be able to update the chart by filtering in a useful way(s)
    3.  The data should also be shown in a table or a list
    4.  Demonstrate 2 ways of passing props to components.

## The requirements

- The app fetches data from the API and displays it in the UI
- The app is built with React. Beyond this, feel free to use any libraries, frameworks or tools that you like.
- Your app is easy to install and run locally
- It's beautiful and looks great at all screen sizes.

## For extra bonus points you could...

These aren't required for this challenge, just some ideas for nice-to-haves :)

- Deploy the app somewhere
- Show an offline message if you lose browser connectivity
